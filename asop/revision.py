"""The revision policy — what an agent may not do to a procedure.

Self-revision is the ASOP property with a behavioural claim behind it, and it
is also a write path into the procedures people follow. Left unpoliced, any
actor with write access could revise any ASOP to anything. That is acceptable
while every reviser is a person. It is not acceptable the moment an agent can
propose a revision, because an agent that learns "this step is slow" and
removes the step is doing exactly what the loop asks of it — and the step it
removed may have been the one that keeps a delinquency run from sending
letters that cannot be unsent.

**This is contract, not plane.** The rules are about **trust domains**, not
about content: a human reviser is bound by none of them, and what they protect
— which steps exist, which are human, which carry `money` — is registry
content neither a plane nor a harness holds on the other's behalf. So both
sides enforce the same rules from this one implementation, and
`ASOP.md` §6.4 is its specification. A rule that held on the plane and not in
the runtime would be a rule with a door beside it.

Four rules, generic to every registry.

1. **Protected tags freeze a step against agents.** A version carrying a
   protected tag (`money` and `irreversible` by default; a registry may add its
   own, never remove these) cannot be revised or activated by an agent at all,
   and no agent revision may add or remove a protected tag on any step. Only a
   human decides what is protected, and only a human touches what is.
2. **A step's class ratchets toward human only.** An agent may turn an agent
   step into a human one; it may never turn a human step into an agent one, or
   into an unclassified one, which is the same demotion by omission — deleting
   the step included, since that is the demotion that leaves nothing behind to
   classify. On a FIRST activation the ratchet is ABSOLUTE rather than
   differential: baseline and target are the same version, so every
   differential check is vacuous and the question becomes whether an agent may
   put a human step into service at all. It may not.
3. **No undoing a human.** An agent revision may not move any field into a
   state a human moved it away from — bring back what a human removed, remove
   what a human added, or restore what a human replaced — unless a human later
   moved it back. Computable because versions are immutable and each records
   who authored it. Versions written before authorship was recorded impose
   nothing: neither side invents a human it never saw.
4. **`human_only` verbs.** `retire` and `promote` are human verbs (ASOP.md §4,
   §6.5). They are not a diff — there is no proposed version to compare — so
   they are refused to an agent whatever they would produce.

**Who is human is declared, never inferred.** The operator names human actors
(`AGENTCO_HUMANS`); everyone else is an agent. The default fails closed — an
undeclared registry treats every reviser as an agent and polices all of them —
because the alternative, an agent that becomes human by asserting it, would
make the whole policy a suggestion. The plane states this posture alongside
its three other declaration sets in `agentco/policy.py`'s module docstring;
they differ deliberately, so read all four before changing this one to match
another.

Every refusal names the rule and the field so the caller learns what to change
rather than that something was wrong. A refused revision writes nothing.
